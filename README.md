## Getting Started
NOTE: These directions are targeted at Mac Users.

### Vagrant
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) is a great way to quickly get started on Helpful.

Pre-requisites:

* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) - Download from http://vagrantup.com/downloads

Once you have Vagrant installed run:

    vagrant up

This will take a while to run so you may want to grab some coffee.

Once Vagrant finishes follow the onscreen instructions to finish the install process. That's it.

## Advanced Configuration

### Email

#### Sending with Gmail

In development.rb, add:

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
        address:              'smtp.gmail.com',
        port:                 587,
        domain:               'example.com',
        user_name:            'your_gmail_username',
        password:             'your_gmail_password',
        authentication:       'plain',
        enable_starttls_auto: true
    }

#### Recieving with Mailgun (optional)

Setting up [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) in development takes a little work but allows you to use the
actual email workflow used in production.

1. Register for a free account at https://mailgun.com.
2. Get your Mailgun API key from https://mailgun.com/cp it starts with "key-"
and add it to your .env file as MAILGUN_API_KEY.
4. Get your Mailgun test subdomain from the same page and add it to your .env
file as INCOMING_EMAIL_DOMAIN.
5. In order to recieve webhooks from Mailgun we need to expose our development
instance to the outside world. We can use a tool called
[Ngrok](http://ngrok.com) for this. Download and setup Ngrok by following the
instructions on the [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com) site.
6. Run rake mailgun to make sure everything is setup right. It should prompt you
to create a route using `rake mailgun:create_route`.
7. Run `rake mailgun:create_route` and when prompted enter your Ngrok address
as the domain name.
8. Send a test email to helpful@INCOMING_EMAIL_DOMAIN and you should see it
appear in the helpful account.
